        "To any able bodied adventurer, Dreary cove town has not sent their taxes in nearly three months. My subjects love paying taxes, who doesn't?",
        "Recently there have been terrible rumors and I fear the worst! Talk of the undead has surfaced and I need you to silence these troubles.",
        "With haste, head to the town and investigate! If you are able to determine and fix the problem, you will be rewarded with 200 gold pieces.", 
        "Time is of utmost importance here, I fear someone is trying to raise an undead army. Signed, King Erich"
